<h1>My Favourite Food</h1>
<h2>1. Chicken Rice</h2>
<img src="nasi ayam.jpeg" class="center3">
<p>My first favourite food is chicken rice. Chicken rice contains a delighful dishes such as the yellow rice with a roasted chicken accompanying with a slice of cucumber
    and tomato. Also, with a cup of soup. The taste levels depend on the restaurant that made it 
    because some restaurant didn't make it well.</p>

<h2>2. Nasi Kandar</h2>
<img src="nasi kandar.jpg" class="center3">
<p>My next favourite food is nasi kandar. The name nasi kandar came about from a time when nasi (rice) hawkers or vendors would balance a 
    "kandar pole" on their shoulder with two huge containers of rice meals. The name has remained today and Nasi Kandar's word appears 
    in most Tamil Muslim or “Malaysian Mamak” restaurants and Indian-Muslim food stall. In nasi kandar you can put whatever dishes you like for 
    example fried chicken, papadom, kambing masak kurma and many more. For me my dishes is a plate of nasi kandar with extra rice with fried chicken and papadom.</p>

<h2>3. Nasi Lemak Kuning</h2>

<p>This is my favourite breakfast. People around me would rather call it a brunch because the dishes portion is like eating lunch. Nasi lemak kuning has a fragrance 
    aroma that no other nasi lemak has on it. In my portion, I would like to eat it with fried chicken or "daging masak hitam". The store locate near old cinema 
    called Kapitol. Its open from 7 a.m till 1 p.m and it's the oldest restaurant in Parit Buntar.

</p>

<h2>4. Vanilla Icecream</h2>

<p>Lastly, my favourite light desert that is vanilla icecream. Everytime I buy an icecream I would prefer vanilla first. I'm not only eating vanilla icecream only
    but also eat with chocolate syrup or chocolate chip.
