    <h1>My Personal Interest</h1>
    <h2>Motorcycle</h2>
    <img src="motorcycle.webp" class="center3">
    <p>I have interest in motorcycle. It doesn't matter what it type or model. I like to know about how the engine was made
        and what's make it unique than the other motor. For example is  Kawasaki H2R where it can reach top speed about 400km/h and 
        SYM VF3i where the first small motorcycle with a large of engine power where it has 183cc engine.
    </p>
    <h2>JDM Car</h2>
    <img src="jdm car.jpg" class="center3">
    <p>For some reason I also like JDM cars. JDM stands for Japan Direct Manufacture thats is a car where its only being made and sell in Japan.
    JDM cars has many variation from wagon, sedan, minivan also sport car. For example of JDM cars you can see in the image below that is Honda NSX, 
    Nissan GTR R34, Toyota Supra, Mitsubishi Lancer, Mazda RX7 and Subaru WRX. All of these was a legend and until now
    car community still profiled them as a beast in a the road. I hope I own one of this car.</p>
