    <h1>My Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <img src="reading.jpg" class="center3">
    <p>In my leisure time, I like to do some reading such as light novel, comic book, and newspaper. Reading is fun 
        because while reading its like you in that book world in the same time gain your knowledge eventhough some of it 
        I don't get it all.
    </p>
    <h2>Diy Crafting</h2>
    <img src="crafting.jpg" class="center3">
    <p>Crafting time sometimes came when I was bored and nothing to do. So, I do some crafting like a bookmark, pen holder and
        also my own book shelf. Crafting teach me how to spell all of my creativity on something and also being patience in the process. Eventhough the result
    is not so satisfied but I'm still learning and try to improve it from time to time. It is crafting fun?</p>
