    <h1>My Education</h1>
    <h2>Primary School: SK Besout 3</h2>
    <img src="besout 3.jpg" class="center3">
    <p>In year 2003, I start learning as a kindergarten and in that time I was only a 4 year's old child. My mother also a teacher in this school before
        she being moved in into another school called SK Besout 5. After I has being graduated from kindergarten, I start my education life as a primary school student
        in Primary 1 until it ended in Primary 6 where I took the UPSR's examination and got a flying color results. There were so many moment 
        that cannot be describe as a text. Sadly, in 2012 my parent has bought a house in Bandar Baharu and we has to moved out. I has to leave 
        my childhood friend that has being friend with me in such a long time. I hope I can see them again.
    </p>
    <h2>High School: SMK Pekan Baru</h2>
    <img src="pekan baru.png" class="center3">
    <p>I start being a high school student in year 2012 after I moved in my new house located at Bandar Baharu, Kedah. This school
        located in a small residency area called Taman Pekan Baru in Parit Buntar city. I start my class in Form 1 with meeting my first friend 
        who also live in same residency as I am but from year to year we has being apart because he being sign in into another classes. So, I think maybe 
        it just me alone. My thought was wrong, from time to time I became more close with my classmates and always jokes and laugh together.
        One of it was my BFF that always there beside me when I has a problems or other else. Now, he's at Putrajaya live there with his sister and 
        pursuing his studies in UiTM Puncak Alam, Shah Alam. I graduated from high school in 2016 when I was Form 5 and my SPM results just 
        an average. So, university is next maybe?
    </p>
    <h2>Form 6: SMK Panglima Bukit Gantang</h2>
    <img src="panglima.jpg" class="center3">
    <p>So, because my SPM result is not qualified enough to enter any university I decided to pursue my studies in
        Form 6 or can be called as Pre-University/Diploma. During my 2 years in Form 6, many up and down has came into me
        but I also make as much as I can memorable moment and enjoyed being a Form 6 student. The reason is mostly it is still
        feel like studying in school eventhough the studies level is the same as Diploma student's level. In year 2018, I graduated 
        from Form 6 and my STPM results is qualified enough to enter a university. My hope in that moment was I can pursuing
        my studies in things that I most interested that is being a librarian.
    </p>
    <h2>Degree Student: Universiti Teknologi Mara</h2>
    <img src="uitm.jpg" class="center3">
    <p>After I apply to enter any universities I want by filling the Unit Pusat Universiti(UPU) application, I has to wait for a several month.
        During time that I work as a part-time pizza delivery guy at Dominos Pizza in Mydin Mall, Parit Buntar. After many month being gone
        passed, the result of the university student intake has being announced and I'm grateful that UiTM offered me with a courses
        that I want most to pursue it that is Library Management. It has being 1 year and right now I'm a proud UiTM Part 3 students and my dream
        is to make a library as place that people come to have a fun time. May Allah ease my Degree year.</p>
